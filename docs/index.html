<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Bézier curves and Bézier surfaces are some of the main components that give an object its shape through linear interpolation by 
using de Casteljau's Algorithm. In this project I go over the implementation of de Casteljau's algorithm and the subdivision of meshes
through edge splits and edge flips. Subdivision is another great way of creating smooth objects through the 4-1 subdivision of 
triangles. This creates the amount of detail in a object in terms of shading and texture.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bézier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bézier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p>Performing de Casteljau's algorithm is a linear time operation that calculates a mid-point between two control points. For instance
if we were working with n control points, de Casteljau's algorithm returns (n - 1) points through linear interpolation. I iterate 
through two control points at a time to receive a new midpoint between these two points. The new point is calculated by multiplying 
the first control point in the iteration by (1 - t) and the second control point in the iteration by t. The value t is a float in the
range [0, 1]. I then add these two points to finally retrieve the correct position in 2D space. I then store this new point into the 
vector data structure. Once all pair of points have been interpolated and pushed into the vector, we return this new vector of points. 
Upon successful calls to the function that performs these steps we should be able to achieve a final point were the Bézier curve would 
pass through. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bézier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
<p>Bézier surfaces is similar to what I did in the first process. However, Bézier surfaces requires us to interpolate a 2D vector 
instead of interpolating a 1D vector like we did in task one. The interpolation process was essentially the same as the Bézier curve 
where we acquired new midpoint vertices between a pair of control points. Since we are dealing with a 2D vector(a vector inside a 
vector), I first iterated through each individual vector inside the 2D vector and evaluated each individual vector with a 
corresponding u value by calling a function that would recursively evaluate each step of de Casteljau's algorithm until it finally 
returned one point on the Bézier curve. I pushed each individual evaluated point onto another vector and called the same recursive 
method with its corresponding v value until I finally once again retrieved the last point. This last point is what lies on the moving 
Bézier curve.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
<p> To evaluate the weighted normal of a point I used the halfedge datastructure to guide me through mesh traversals. Given the 
halfedge at a vertex, I began my traversal at that halfedge by first acquiring the 3 points of the first triangle. I stored these 
points into separate Vector3D variables. To acquire the first point I simply point towards the halfedge->vertex(), the second point
is found by pointing towards the twin halfedge vertex and the last point is found by the twin's->next->next->vertex. Once I have all 
three points I find the tangent lines of point one to point two and point one to point three. With these tangent lines I can then 
compute the cross prodct of the two tangent lines to get receieve an area weighted Vector3D. I add the sum of this vector to another 
dummy Vector3D with values 0. I then move on to the next triangle mesh surronding the initial vertex and repeat this same process 
until I have traveresed all neighboring triangles. Once I have the sum of all area weighted vectors I find its normal by using the 
equation 1 / sqrt(x^2, y^2, z^2) and return its corresponding unit vector.  </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
<p>Given an edge as a parameter I had to rearrange all pointers that belonged to the halfedge of the edge passed in. This meant 
that I first had to store every single detail about the mesh before being able to set pointers on variables with important 
information. This is where drawing out an image of a halfedge came into play for my success. The pictures below show all of the 
important details that belonged to that halfedge. In this case the edge that was passed in. As you can see, I stored h0-h9, v0-v4, 
e0-e4, and f0-f1 so that I could begin the process of overwriting the pointers of every element. Being able to see the after image of
the flip came in handy as it visually shows all the changes one would have to make to set the correct pointers for the halfedges. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
<p>The process of splitting an edge was an eventful one. This was very similiar to flipping edges where I had to first store every 
pointer of the halfedge into different variables so that I would not loose any information during the rearrangment of pointers. A key
difference in this part was that I had to add new components making it a little more difficult to keep track of pointers. However, 
just like before I found it very useful to draw a before and after image of edge splitting to help me arragne pointers. I had to set 
correct pointers for every halfedge that was part of the triangles interior. When splitting an edge the output is a triangle with two 
new faces, three new edges, 6 new halfedges, and one new vertice. Therefore, to properly rearrange pointets with these new components 
my drawing came in handy to successfully point at correct values.  </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
<p>For subdivision I implemented this mesh upsampling by using the functions edge split and edge flip. To begin this process of 
  upsampling I precomputed the vertex positons by iterating through the mesh edges and the mesh vertices. To update the old vertices 
  and new vertices there was a weighted scheme that helped us derive the correct positions. For the new vertices I iterated through 
  the edges and used this equation 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D). Here A, B are adjacent and are the vertex positions in space and C, 
  D are not adjacent and are two differnt vertex in space for the same mesh. This new position was then stored inside the edges 
  pointer for newPosition to later on introduce this position the new vertex after splitting.
</p>

<p>To update the old vertex, I traversed the mesh vertices and used this weighted scheme instead (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * 
original_neighbor_position_sum. Where n is the vertex degree, u is a fixed number, original_position is the current vertex position, 
and original_neighbor_position_sum is the sum of neighboring position for the halfedge. This value is right away stored inside the 
vertex position.</p>


<p>After precomputing the old and new vertices I then had to traverse the edges again and begin the splitting proccess. Since the 
function edgeSplits returns the new vertex, I was then able to update the position of the returned vertex with the pointer I had
stored earlier inside edge newPosition. Making it efficient to update the values. I then had to check for edge flips whenever an old 
vertex and new vertex were adjacent to one another. I did this only if the edge was new when we split. I then perform a final 
iteration through the vertices and update their positions with their newPositions.</p>

<p>As we see above the sharp corners and edges start to become smooth as we subdivide further. If I split edges before subdividing 
the effects are reduced but the image starts to acquire holes as we see below. </p>

<p> The same can be seen with the cube. However, when can split as many times as we want and perhaps flip at times to make the cube 
  become symmetrical during subdivision. This is because if we split first then the mesh has a numerous amount of vertices that are 
  not accounted for when we subdivide. This means that our vertex approximation when updating the values are somewhat skewed. Now this
  can be a good or bad since we are trying to retain the property of the shape.
